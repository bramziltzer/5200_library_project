# 5200_library_project

We are using MySQLWorkbench and Python3 to run the project.

Please update python to version 3.10 or later to ensure the 'match...case' function works.

Install prettytable: python3 -m pip install -U prettytable
Install PyMySQL: python3 -m pip install PyMySQL

Use the data import feature of MySQLWorkbench to import the dump file 'library_system_dump.sql', 
which creates the database and inserts sample data.

Finally, navigate to the project folder containing 'main.py' and run the application in the command line using 'python3 city_library_system.py'.

Use the root username and password for your MySQL server to log in.
