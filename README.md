# 5200_library_project

We use MySQLWorkbench and PyCharm to run the whole project.

Need python version 3.10 or later so that the "match...case" function works.

Install prettytable: python3 -m pip install -U prettytable

First run the "library schema.sql" to build the schema and then the "datas for library project" to have some simple datas.

Finally open the "main.py" file to start working on the project.
